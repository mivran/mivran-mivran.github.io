As awareness comes lately, I come late too in trying out a simple blog in this form (github hosting+jekyll to explore). It is a nice path I wanted to try since time though, and in fact the tutorial I'm following, Hank Quinlan's Horrible Cop, is six years old. This delay depends from a personal bias as well from the local one of being immersed in another language than english; but time circumstances affect more the first aspect. Hopefully I will articulate something sensate about what is bringing to this simple but challenging experience in the following posts. See you soon!
