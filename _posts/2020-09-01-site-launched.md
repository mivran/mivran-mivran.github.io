As awareness comes lately, I come late too in trying out a simple blog in this form (github hosting+jekyll to explore). It is a nice path I wanted to try since time though, and in fact the tutorial I'm following, Hank Quinlan's Horrible Cop, is six years old. This depends from a personal as well as the local bias of being immersed in other language than english, but here it is rather the first case. Hopefully I will tell something sensate about what is bringing to this simple but challenging experience. See you soon!
