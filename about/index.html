  		<h1>Biographics (Michele Barontini)</h1>
  		<p>Considered the enormous amount of indecision it can involve giving an account my life in three lines (and surely in many paragraphs is even worse), I am confronted here with the double task of passing beyond it and without cheating too much. So, I guess the best way to solve this is to point outside the screen, to the books around me. They are not so many, but they are so various and different, in such a way that their variety is still surprising me after may years I'm living with them. They will be around anything I write, timely or not, interesting or less interesting, and I may say that if their material form is more or less inside the span of a life of two, reading them can involve way deeper and more powerful time-machineries.</p>
